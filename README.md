**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
  Our client, The Gaming Room, who requested help elevating their Android game named 'Draw IT or Lose IT'. They requested a web-based version of that game be created that would allow for cross-platform functionality.\
  The software also needed to ensure only one instance of the game could be active at a time, the team and game names needed to be unique and searchable.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
  I think I did particularly well in dertimining the requirements and design constraints. Then making a plan of action to address the clients concerns.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
  Creating the UML Diagram was the most helpful part of creating the design document. It easily allowed me to visualize the program classes and how they're connected.


**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
  If I could choose I would probably spend a bit more time working on the Evaluation of different platforms. I would want to improve it by elaborating on the possibilities for each platform.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
  It is important to know what the client considers high priority for the software because they are the ones who will use it. For this assignment we were given clear cut request with a list of priorities for this software from the client, such as:
   - The client would like Draw It or Lose It to communicate between various platforms
   - Security is a must-have for the client. Explain how to protect user information on and between various platforms.
   - etc.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
  I approached this software design by understanding the client's requirements, followed by careful planning, and iterative development.
  Future designs should also utilize siagrams in the planning stage, modular development(use of interconnected classes), and prioritize user experience and maintainability.
